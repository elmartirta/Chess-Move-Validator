This project is put on hiatus, but for my
future self, willing to pick up this project
once more, here are some of the details:

------------- July 22 2021 ----------------

The Chess Move Verifier is a program that takes
a file, written in .PGN notation, and confirms
whether or not the entire file is valid.

Right now, you can run tests on the project using
test.sh. Currently, the most advanced
test takes a set of hard-coded moves, compiled into
a game object tree, and verifies that these moves
result in a valid, legal game. (Without taking into
consideration the 50 move rule, or complex issues involving
more than one position at a time.)

The current issues that prevent it from full functionality are these:
- Converting a .pgn file to a Game Object 
    instantiated in Python is unimplemented, 
    but through some REGEX magic and perhaps 
    some parsing trees, it should work.
    See the design drawings for more information.
- When the user types in python verifier.py, without any
    command line arguments, there should be a command line
    application that walks the user through either: verifying
    a file, or creating a new .pgn file from a step by step
    process. However, it may be more useful to defer this to
    another project.

To you from the future, picking this up, Good luck, and take
care. Drink water, and have fun :D
